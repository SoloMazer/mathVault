### def: (Continuous Functions)
The function f(x) is said to be *continuous* at $a$ if and only if $$\lim_{ x \to a }f(x)=f(a)$$
#### Examples:
#### Note:
When a function is referred to as continuous, it is implied that it satisfies the definition of continuity at every point within its domain of definition, and no assumption is made about points outside this domain.
#### Properties:
1. The sum $f(x)+g(x)$ and the product $f(x)g(x)$ of two continuous functions are continuous; the quotient $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ is defined and continuous at $a$ if and only if $g(a)\neq0$.
2. If $f(x)$ is continuous, so are $\mathrm{Re}(f(x)), \mathrm{Im}(f(x)),\text{ and }|f(x)|$.
