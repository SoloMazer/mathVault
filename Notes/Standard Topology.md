### def:
If $\mathcal{B}$ is the collection of all open intervals in the real line, $$
(a,b)=\{x|a<x<b\},$$
the topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is called the standard topology on the real line. Whenever we consider $\mathbb{R}$, we shall suppose that it is given this topology unless we specifically state otherwise. 

If $\mathcal{B'}$ is the collection of all half-open intervals of the form $$
[a,b)=\{x|a\leq x<b\}
$$
where $a<b$, the topology generated by $\mathcal{B'}$ is called the lower limit topology on $\mathbb{R}$. When $\mathbb{R}$ is given the lower limit topology, we denote it by $\mathbb{R}_{l}$.

Let $K$ denote the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{1}{n}$, for $n \in \mathbb{Z_{+}}$ and let $\mathcal{B''}$ be the collection of all open intervals $(a,b)$, along with all sets of the form $(a,b)-K$. the topology generated by $\mathcal{B''}$ will be called the $K$-topology on $\mathbb{R}$. When $\mathbb{R}$ is given this topology, we denote it by $\mathbb{R}_{k}$.
#### Lemma:
1. The topologies of $\mathbb{R}_{l}\text{ and }\mathbb{R}_{k}$ are strictly finer than the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$, but are not comparable with one another. #revisit
