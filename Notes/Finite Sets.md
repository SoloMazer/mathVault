A set $A$ is said to be finite is there is a bijective correspondence of $A$ with some section of the positive integers. That is, $A$ is finite if it is empty or there is a bijection $$
f:A\to \{1,\dots,n\}
$$
for some positive integer $n$. In the former case, we say that $A$ has cardinality $0$; in the latter case, we say that $A$ has cardinality $n$.
