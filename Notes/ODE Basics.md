### def: 
An ODE is a relation between the derivatives $y, y', \dots, y^{n}$ and the functions of $x$.
#### Examples:
#### Note:
Along with derivatives of $y$ (the dependent variable) with respect to $x$ (the independent variable), note that an ODE may contain
1. y itself (the $0th$ derivative), and
2. known functions of $x$ (including constants)
### Def: (Order of ODE)
The order of a Differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.
### Def: (Linear Differential Equations)
$F(x,y,y',\dots,y^{n})=0$ is linear if $F$ is a linear function of the variables $y,y',\dots,y^{n}$. Thus, a linear ODE of order n is of the form: $$
a_{0}(x)y^{n}+a_{1}(x)y^{n-1}+\dots+a_{n}(x)y=b(x)
$$
where $a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n}$ are functions of $x$ and $a_{0}\neq0$.
