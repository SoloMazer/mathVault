#### Injective Function:
A function $f:A\to b$ is said to be injective, if for each pair of distinct points of $A$ their images under $f$ are distinct.
$f$ is injective if,$$
[f(a)=f(a')]\implies[a=a']
$$
#### Surjective Function:
A function $f:A\to B$ is said to be a surjective, if every element of $B$ is the image of some element of some element of $A$
under the function $f$. $f$ is surjective if,$$
[b\in B]\implies[b=f(a)\text{ for at least one }a\in A]
$$
#### Bijective Function:
A function $f$ is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.
#### Inverse of Function:
for every bijective function $f$ there exists a inverse function denoted by $f^{-1}$ and is defined by letting $f^{-1}(b)=a$,
where $a$ is a unique element, for which $f(a)=b$.
#### Left inverse of a function:
Let $f:A\to B$ be a function, and $\exists\:$ a function $g:B\to A\text{ st. }g(f(a))=a$ for every $a\in A$, then the 
function $g$ is called left inverse of $f$.
#### Right inverse of a function:
Let $f:A\to B$ be a function, and $\exists\:$ a function $h:A\to B\text{ st. }f(h(a))=b$ for every $b\in B$, then the 
function $h$ is called right inverse of $f$.
#### lemma:
Let $f:A\to B$. If there are functions $g:B\to A$ and $h:A\to B$  such that $g(f(a))=a$ for every $a\text{ in }A$ and 
$f(h(b))=b$ for every $b\text{ in }B$  then f is bijective and $g=h=f^{-1}$.
