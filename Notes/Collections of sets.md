### Def (Collections of sets):
The set which has its elements as sets themselves, is called a collection of set.
#### Examples:
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a set of 4 deck of cards, in this set each deck of card is a set in itself and hence $\mathcal{A}$ is a collection of sets.
### Def (Arbitrary Union and Intersection of Sets):
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be collection of sets, the union of elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is
$$
\bigcup_{A\:\in\:\mathcal{A}}\:=\:\{\:x|\:x\:\in\:A\:\text{for at least one}\:A\:\in\:\mathcal{A}\}
$$
Similarly we define intersection as,
$$
\bigcap_{A\:\in\:\mathcal{A}}\:=\:\{x\:|\:x\:\in\:A\:\text{for every}\:A\:\in\:\mathcal{A}\:\}
$$
##### Note:
Consider an empty collection of sets, the only element/s of $\mathcal{A}$ is the empty set $\phi$, it follows from the definition of Union that, 
$$
\bigcup_{A\:\in\:\mathcal{A}}\:=\:\phi
$$
However, when we look at the intersection every $x$ for the Universal set $X$ satisfies (vacuously) the defining property for intersection of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ and causes a set theoretic breakdown (in my brain), so we shall not define the intersection when $\mathcal{A}$ is empty.
