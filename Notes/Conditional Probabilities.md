#### def:
Let $E\text{ and }F$ be two event for a sample space $S$ in an experiment. The probability of event $E$ given that $F$ has already occurred is denoted as $P(E|F)$ and defined as: $$
P(E|F)=\frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}
$$
#### Examples:
1. Suppose cards numbered one through ten are placed in a hat, mixed up and then one of the cards is drawn. If we are told that the number on the drawn card is at least five, then what is the conditional probability that it is ten?
	Solu: Let $E$ denote the event that the number of the drawn card is ten, and let $F$ be the event that it is at least five. The desired Probability is $P(E|F)$. $$
P(E|F)=\frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}=\frac{\frac{1}{10}}{\frac{6}{10}}=\frac{1}{6}
$$
