#### Operations on Sets: 
Given two sets $A\text{ and }B$ the union, intersection and difference of the sets is defined as following: $$A\cup B=\{x|x \in A\text{ or }x \in B\}$$$$A\cap B=\{x|x \in A\text{ and }x \in B\}$$
$$
A-B=\{x|x \in A\text{ and }x \not\in B\}
$$
#### Note:
1. "P or Q" means either P holds, or Q holds, or both of them hold. This convention is followed by mathematicians to avoid ambiguity.
2. The set A-B is also called *complement of B in A*.
#### Properties:
1. $A\cap(B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$.
2. $A\cup(B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)$.
3. $A-(B\cup C)=(A-B)\cap(A-C)$.
4. $A-(B\cap C)=(A-B)\cup(A-C)$.
