### def:
The derivative of a function is defined as a particular limit and can be considered regardless of whether the variables are real or complex. The formal definition is $$
f'(a)=\lim_{ x \to a } \frac{{f(x)-f(a)}}{x-a}
$$ 
#### Examples:
#### Note:
1. A real function of a complex variable either has the derivative zero, or else the derivative does not exist. ( #revisit )
2. The case of a complex function of a real variable can be reduced to the real case. If we write $z(t)=x(t)+iy(t)$ we find indeed $$
z'(t)=x'(t)+iy'(t)
$$
	and the existence of $z'(t)$ is equivalent to the simultaneous existence of $x'(t)\text{ and }y'(t)$.
#### Properties:
1. The usual rules for forming the derivative of a sum, a product, or a quotient are all valid. 
2. The derivative of a composite function is determined by the chain rule.
