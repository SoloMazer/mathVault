#### def: ( largest element, bounded above, upper bound, supremum)
Suppose that $A$ is a set ordered by the relation $<$. Let $A_{0}$ be a subset of $A$. We say that the element b is the *largest element* of $A_{0}$ if $b\in A_{0}$ and if $x\leq b$ for every $x \in A_{0}$. Similarly, we say that a is the *smallest element* of $A_{0}$ if $a\in A_{0}$ and if $a\leq x$ for every $x \in A_{0}$.
We say that the subset $A_{0}\text{ of }A$ is *bounded above* if there is an element $b$ of $A$ such that $x\leq b$ for every $x \in A_{0}$; the element $b$ is called the upper bound for $A_{0}$. If the set of all upper bounds for $A_{0}$ has a smallest element, that element is called the *least upper bound* or *Supremum* of $A_{0}$. It is denoted by sup($A_{0}$); it may or may not belong to $A_{0}$. If it does, it is the largest element of $A_{0}$.
Similarly, $A_{0}$ is *bounded below* if there is an element $a\text{ of }A$ such that $a\leq x$ for every $x \in A_{0}$; the element $a$ is called a lower bound for $A_{0}$. If the set of all lower bounds for $A_{0}$ has a largest element, that element is called the *greatest lower bound*, or the *infrimum*, of $A_{0}$. It is denoted by inf$(A_{0})$; it may or may not belong to $A_{0}$. If it does, it is the smallest element of $A_{0}$.
#### def: (Least upper bound Property)
An ordered set $A$ is said to have the *least upper bound property* if every nonempty subset of $A_{0}\text{ of }A$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Analogously, the set $A$ is said to have the *greatest lower bound property* if every nonempty subset $A_{0}\text{ of }A$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound.
#### Note: 
$A$ has the least upper bound property if and only if it has the greatest lower bound property.
