### def:
Two events $E\text{ and }F$ are said to be *independent* if $$
P(E\cap F)=P(E)P(F)
$$
From the definition of conditional probability, it follows that, $E\text{ and }F$ are independent if $$
P(E|F) = P(E)
$$
That is, $E\text{ and }F$ are independent if knowledge that $F$ has occurred does not affect the probability that $E$ occurs, ie occurrence of $E$ is independent of whether or not $F$ occurs.
