Consider an Experiment whose sample space is $S$. For each event $E$ of the sample space $S$, we assume that a number $P(E)$ is defined and satisfies the following three conditions:
1. $0\leq P(E)\leq 1$.
2. $P(S)=1$.
3. For any sequence of events $E_{1},E_{2},\dots$ that are mutually exclusive, that is, events for which $E_{n}E_{m}=\emptyset$ when $n\neq m$, then $$
P\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_{n} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}P(E_{n})
$$
we refer to $P(E)$ as the probability of the event $E$.
