*Polynomial ring*, denoted as $R[x]$, is the set of all polynomials over a ring $R$. Formally,$$
R[x]=\{a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x+a_{0}\:|\:n\in \mathbb{N}\text{ and }a_{i}\in R\}
$$
The *degree* of $f(x)$ is the largest $n$, such that $a_{n}\neq 0$.
we define Addition on $R[x]$ as follows:
