Let $A$ be a set of positive integers. Suppose that for each positive integer $n$, the statement $S_{n}\subset A$ implies the statement $n\in A$. Then $A=\mathbb{Z}_{+}$.
#### Proof:
If $A$ does not equal all of $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$, let $n$ be the smallest positive integer that is not in $A$. Then every positive integer less than $n$ is in $A$, so that $S_{n}\subset A$. our hypothesis implies that $n\in A$, contrary to assumption.
