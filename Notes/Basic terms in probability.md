1. The set of all possible outcomes of a experiment is known as the *sample space* of the experiment and is denoted by $S$.
2. A subset $E$ of the sample space $S$ is known as an *Event*.
3. Let $E\text{ and }F$ be two events such that $E\cap F=\emptyset$, then $E\text{ and }F$ are said to be mutually exclusive.
4. For any event $E$ we define the new event $E^{c}$, referred to as the *complement* of $E$, to consist of all outcomes in the sample space $S$ that are not in E.

#### Properties:
1. (Inclusion-Exclusion Principle):$$
P(E_{1}\cup E_{2}\cup\dots \cup E_{n})=\sum_{i}P(E_{i})-\sum_{i<j}P(E_{i}E_{j})+\sum_{i<j<k}P(E_{i}E_{j}E_{k})-\sum_{i<j<k<l}P(E_{i}E_{j}E_{k}E_{l})+\dots+(-1)^{n+1}P(E_{1}E_{2}\dots E_{n})
$$
